## TWEET-AND-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

# UNDERSTANDING  THE BASIC IDEA OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
The project started with one of the course taken on course era to understand basic concepts of deep neural networks and machine learning
understnding logistic regression ,gradient desent,shallow neural networks with forward and backward propagation,build and train neural networks with one or more hidden layer using python vectoriztion.

# EXPLORING CONCEPT OF NLP
Followed by that I tried to the learn some concept of NLP like tokenization of tweet ,stemming,lemmatiztion,Bag of words HMM,TF-IDF features.I come to know need of tokenization,stemming the words to root word,remove the words with maximum ocurrences like he,she,punctuation, and count on the medium ocurrences word over with TF-IDF.And still on the way to explore it and learn more about nltk library  .

# UNDERSTANDING WORD2VEC
I have explored the word2vec feature its importance in question answering task and it can be helpful to capture words with similiar meaning
as the word with similiar meaning vectors are collinear and tried to work on word2vec models.


# ON THE WAY TO LEARN BERT
I am currently trying to learn bert algoritm and fine tuning.

I have also read several notebooks on kaggle understanding some of the above concepts and how to approach  the solution of the problem set and also hand on project of twitter sentiment analysis on analytics vidya and various steps to approach the solution like data cleaning,applying tf-idf feature ,logistics regression etc.
to cover
